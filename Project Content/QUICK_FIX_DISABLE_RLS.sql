-- QUICK FIX: Temporarily disable RLS on problematic tables
-- This is the fastest way to get Frame 7 working
-- WARNING: This makes the tables accessible to all authenticated users
-- Use this for testing only!

-- Disable RLS on admin_users (causing the recursion)
ALTER TABLE public.admin_users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Disable RLS on activity_logs (for consistency)
ALTER TABLE public.activity_logs DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Grant necessary permissions
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON public.activity_logs TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.admin_users TO authenticated;

-- Verify
SELECT 
  'RLS DISABLED - Frame 7 should now work!' AS status,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.activity_logs) AS activity_logs_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.admin_users) AS admin_users_count;
